# Notes
Timeline comes from Friendly.

Tukey (statistician) was one of the first people in the modern era (1950s) to emphasize the need for visualization.

Plots really haven't changed super much in a while. The Playfair, Minard, and Nightingale plots are relatively modern.

Good point: map traits to similar graphical aesthetics. For example, month and angle are periodic, so it would often be nice to map months to angle on a plot.
