Forked from @denniscwylie for the Data Visualization short course offered by the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CCBB) at the University of Texas at Austin [link](http://ccbb.utexas.edu/shortcourses.html#data).

## This fork
I forked this repository mainly to follow along, but be able to make my own edits and changes for future reference.

## Info
The Jupyter notebook and R files do exactly the same thing. The Jupyter notebook actually just uses R.
